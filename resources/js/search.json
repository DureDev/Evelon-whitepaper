This project is a game changer in the world of NFTs and image generation. Evelon uses AI to generate high-quality images, making it possible to create NFTs with unique visuals that are both dynamic and engaging.","NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or piece of content. They have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to be traded, bought and sold like any other asset. The rise of NFTs has created a new market for digital art, collectibles and even virtual real estate. However, the process of creating and deploying NFTs can be complex and time-consuming, especially for those without technical expertise.","Evelon solves this problem by providing a no code platform that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. With Evelon, anyone can create dynamic NFTs without any coding skills. The platform uses AI to generate high-quality images, making it possible to create NFTs that are both unique and visually appealing. Additionally, Evelon allows you to easily manage and trade your NFTs, making it a one-stop shop for all your NFT needs."]},{"l":"Features","p":["One of the key features of Evelon is its dynamic image generation.

It has the potential to revolutionize the way we do things in numerous industries, including the world of NFTs. NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain network. They are becoming increasingly popular as a way to verify the authenticity of digital art and collectibles.","Evelon leverages AI for the image generation in NFTs, offering a no-code solution for creating dynamic NFTs. This platform allows users to create NFTs without needing any technical expertise. The AI-powered image generator can be used to create unique digital assets, including images, videos, and animations. This has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for NFT creators and collectors, who can now easily create NFTs in a variety of styles and forms.","One of the main benefits of AI-generated images is their speed and efficiency. Unlike traditional methods of image creation, AI algorithms can produce an image in a fraction of the time it takes a human artist. This increased speed can lead to increased productivity and profitability for businesses operating in the visual arts industry.","Another advantage of AI-generated images is their ability to reduce costs. By using AI algorithms, businesses can eliminate the need for expensive artists and designers. This reduction in costs can be passed on to the customer, providing an attractive alternative for those seeking affordable visual art solutions."]},{"l":"Technology","p":["Evelon's AI-generated images are also highly versatile. The technology can generate images in a variety of styles, including realistic, cartoonish, and abstract. This versatility allows businesses to create images that are suitable for a wide range of applications, such as advertising, branding, and product design.","In addition, AI-generated images can be used to create customized images that are specific to the customer's needs. This is achieved through machine learning algorithms that can learn from the customer's preferences and create images that are tailored to their needs. This level of personalisation can lead to increased customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.","In conclusion, the introduction of AI-generated images using Evelon technology can revolutionize the visual arts industry. Its benefits of speed, cost-effectiveness, versatility, personalisation, and high quality make it an attractive solution for businesses seeking to stay ahead of the competition. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the world of visual art."]}],[{"l":"Mission and vision"},{"l":"Mission","p":["Evelon's mission is to make it easy for users to create NFTs that are unique, visually appealing, and have a high level of interactivity.

Some of the popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible and Niftables all face similar problems.","Firstly, all of these platforms use static NFTs. This means that the traits of these NFTs remain the same over time, lacking the dynamicity that is required in today's NFT space.","Secondly, there is a lack of a custom build platform that allows users to create and manage their own NFTs. Both OpenSea and Rarible don't offer a customisable platform to users, while Niftables do have customisation features but they are designed by Niftable designers and the UI is not user-friendly.","The lack of real use cases is another problem that all these marketplaces face. The traits of the NFTs won't change over time, making it difficult to create new and innovative use cases for NFTs.","Another issue is the lack of integration with Web2 platforms. OpenSea and Rarible don't have any Web2 integration, while Niftables do offer integration but it is only limited to a few Web2 industries and requires dynamic features, which most industries require.","Lastly, customisation on NFT smart contracts is another problem. OpenSea and Rarible do not offer customisation on NFT smart contracts, while Niftables do offer customisation but the UI is not user-friendly and requires the help of developers."]},{"l":"Benefits","p":["One of the key benefits of Evelon is its ability to use and integrate with DNFT technology. Unlike OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable, Evelon is specifically designed for the use and integration of DNFT technology. Another advantage of Evelon is the ability to deploy a white-label DNFT management panel. This allows users to build their own DNFT marketplaces, mint their NFTs, and create NFT staking platforms without any coding interference. OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable do not offer this functionality.","Evelon also offers the ability to mint and manage DNFTs. This includes the ability to create NFTs using Evelon's platform tools and make changes to existing NFTs without the need for coding skills. Unlike OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable, Evelon provides a comprehensive solution for NFT management.","Evelon provides integration with Web2 industries via API, while OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable only offer limited integration. Evelon also provides a customisable admin panel, allowing users to manage their NFTs and their dynamic utilities with ease.","Evelon supports all EVM compatible chains and the platform can be deployed on any EVM, providing multi-chain support. In contrast, OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable only offer limited multi-chain support.","Evelon also supports both crypto and non-crypto fiat payments, making it a versatile platform for a range of users. This is in contrast to OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable, which only offer limited payment options.","In conclusion, Evelon offers a range of benefits over its competitors, OpenSea, Rarible, and Niftable. With its focus on user experience, customisable admin panel, multi-chain support, and multiple payment options, Evelon provides a comprehensive solution for NFT management and deployment."]}],[{"l":"Features","p":["Affordable: Evelon is an affordable solution, with plans that are designed to fit within your budget.
