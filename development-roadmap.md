In this article, we will be discussing the ten phases of the Evelon Development Roadmap, which outlines the platform's journey from concept to launch.

**Phase 1: Ideation and Conceptualization**

We came up with the idea for the platform and developed a clear vision for what the platform would look like. Then we brainstormed the features and functionality that would be required to make Evelon a success, including the use of AI for image generation and a no-code approach.

**Phase 2: Market Research**

The next phase involved thorough market research to validate the idea and ensure that there was demand for a platform like Evelon. This research helped us to understand the needs and wants of potential users and identify any gaps in the market that could be filled by Evelon.

**Phase 3: Prototyping**

Currently we are working on prototype of the platform, which will allow us to test and refine the various features and functionalities. This is an important step in ensuring that Evelon would be user-friendly and meet the needs of the target audience.

**Phase 4: Design and Development**

Once the prototype is complete, we will move on to the design and development phase, where we would be working on building the platform from the ground up. This will involve a combination of coding, design, and testing to ensure that Evelon would be easy to use and provide a seamless experience for users.

**Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance**

The testing and quality assurance phase is crucial in ensuring that Evelon would be reliable and bug-free when launched. We would be conducting extensive testing to catch any issues before the platform go live.

**Phase 6: Alpha and Beta Releases**

In this phase, the team will release early versions of the platform, known as alpha and beta releases, to a small group of users. These releases will allow the team to gather feedback from real users, make any necessary improvements, and fix any bugs.

**Phase 7: Marketing and Promotion**

With the platform almost ready for launch, the team will began working on marketing and promotion strategies to raise awareness of Evelon and attract potential users. This will involve a combination of digital marketing, social media marketing, and event marketing to reach a wide audience.

**Phase 8: Launch**

The Evelon platform would be officially launch, allowing users to start creating and deploying their own NFTs. This would be a significant milestone for us that will mark the start of Evelon's journey to revolutionize the world of NFTs.

**Phase 9: User Acquisition and Retention**

The team will then continue to work on user acquisition and retention strategies to ensure that the platform would continue to grow and attract new users. This involves a combination of ongoing marketing efforts, product updates, and community engagement.

**Phase 10: Continuous Improvement**

The final phase of the Evelon Development Roadmap involves continuous improvement. The team would be committed to make ongoing improvements to the platform to ensure that it remains relevant and meets the changing needs of users.
